# UFOs Analysis


## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to develop a website allowing users to filter through a list of UFO sightings on multiple criteria at the same time.  The user can filter for the date, city, state, country, and/or shape of provided list of sightings.

## Results

Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

The search tool can be used following the instructions below:

1.	Hit “UFO Sightings”

2.	Enter values for one or more filters 

 

3.	Example of search on 1/1/20 with default values for all other fields.
 

4.	No entries will return the entire list.
5.	Filters are AND not OR, i.e., items returned on list must satisfy all criteria input.
6.	To clear field value, entry must be deleted.
7.	Alternatively, to delete all field inputs (i.e., quick reset) hit “UFO Sightings” to reset values to defaults and return to top of page

## Summary

### Drawback 

There are a number of drawbacks to the current construction of the tool. One is that the input fields are prone to futile searches some of which could be simply due to misspelling or formatting (e.g., CA doesn’t satisfy ca).


### Recommendations for Improvement
Several recommendations are submitted for consideration to improve the experience and enjoyment when using the tool.
1.	Create a “Clear Fields” button
2.	Have pull-downs for city, state, country, and shape. This will limit searches to values actually in the list. 
3.	Change placeholders to give clues to inputter This change has already been made so that the placeholders match the first item on the default list.  This provides user a visual cue as placeholder values match something user sees in list. 
4.	Add filter for Duration
5.	Filters are AND. Create an option to change to OR.
